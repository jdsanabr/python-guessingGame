This program will prompt the user to provide the parameter for a number guessing game. In this case,
it will be the upper limit. For example, the program will say, "Pick a number between 1 and 20,"
20 being the parameter provided by the user.

Though this is a simple program, the primary purpose of this is for me to become familiar with Python syntax.

# program greets user


# ask user for upper limit


# say: pick a number between 1 and [upper limit]


# loop until correct number is guessed


# congratulate user and print how many guesses it took
